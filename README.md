# scurve_motion
 The scurve_motion library is a Rust-based motion planning tool designed to compute S-curve motion profiles between two positions and velocities. S-curve profiles are widely used in motion control applications, such as robotics, CNC machines, and 3D printers, to ensure smooth acceleration and deceleration, minimizing mechanical stress and enhancing precision
